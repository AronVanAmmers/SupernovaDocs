# Migration

The previous versions of SecretJS are not compatible with the supernova upgrade. If you depend on SecretJS, you must upgrade your application to 0.17.0+

## Breaking changes:

The `data` field in `ExecuteResult` is now `string` (changed from `Uint8Array`)

All other interfaces remain the same.
